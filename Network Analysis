P0f
  Passive OS fingerprinting
    looks at variation in initial TTL, fragmentation flag, default IP header packet length, window size, and TCP options
    
    /etc/p0f/p0f.fp
        config file that store signatures/useragents
        
        p0f -i eth0
            runs a signature check on traffic as it passes through that interface
        

Network Traffic Sniffing
    libcap
    WinPcap
    NPCAP
    
    network traffic baselining
        snapshot of what the network looks like during a time frame
        No industry standard
        7 day to establish the initial snapshot 
        prerequisite ibformation
        
    baseline objective
        determine the current state of your network
        ascertain the current utilization of network resources
        identify normal vs peak network traffic time frame
        verify port / protocol usage
    
    Analyze Network Traffic Statistics
        protocol hierarchy
        conversations
        Endpoints

        1st Step
            Set a filter before loading pcap!
        2nd step
            Look at protocol hierarchy
                        FILTER TIPS
                            ...and selected doesnt replace current filter, instead appends
                            CTRL + F and choose the pane to search
                            <field> contains <object> to look for parts with that string
                            sudo tcpdump -r analysis-demo.pcap  "tcp[13] = 0x12" -n | awk '{print $3}' gives ips
                            sudo tcpdump -r analysis-demo.pcap  "tcp[13] = 0x12" -n | awk '{print $3}' | sort -n (numeric)
                            sudo tcpdump -r analysis-demo.pcap  "tcp[13] = 0x12" -n | awk '{print $3}' | sort -n (numeric) | uniq (no dupes)
                            
                            sudo tcpdump -r analysis-demo.pcap  "tcp[13] = 0x12" -n | awk '{print $3}' | cut -d. -f5 gives the port
