Gorgas Network Validation (GNV)
XX OCT 2023
Start Time: ~1300
Duration: 4 hour

Type of Operation: Network & Protocol familiarization, Custom Packet Creation & Manipulation

Objective: Identify and Validate the methods of encapsulation, header manipulation, packet traversal, and header structure in order to assist Gorgan Cyber Forces. Craft Custom ARP Requests and obfuscated ICMPv6 packets to enable Gorgas Cyber Forces to perform effective host discovery and Manipulation. You will use scapy and leverage ARP functions to manually "discover" your windows host, as a valid test case to provide to their cyber forces. You will use scapy and leverage IPv6 auto configuration functions to create a means of IPv6 direct communications between the Linux and Windows Machine.

Task 1

Packet Manipulation

Type of Operation: Reconnaissance and Data Interception

Objective: Intel has been provided about sensitive information being sent over the network from an unknown source to T3. The targets are using ICMP as a covert channel to circumvent security. You are tasked with intercepting this data stream without the target suspecting the data stream has been compromised. You are instructed to perform a man-in-the-middle attack using Gratuitous ARPs from a system on the same network as the target. Utilizing T2, create a SCAPY script to perform a MitM and intercept the data transmission.

    START FLAG = {provided in notification}

    Task: Scapy Man in the Middle (MitM) with ARP

    Utilize the targets T1 , T2 , T3 , and T4 to develop a Scapy MitM using Gratuitous ARPs.

    From T2, perform a ARP poison against T3 to change the gateway (T4) MAC to the MAC of T2 .
    From T2, perform a ARP poison against T4 to change the T3 MAC to the MAC of T2 .

    From T2, utilize TCPDUMP or Wireshark to intercept the FLAG being sent.


--------------------------------------------------------------

Task 2

Packet Manipulation 2

Type of Operation: Reconnaissance and Data Interception

Objective: Intel has been provided about sensitive information being sent over the network from T3 to an unknown target. The targets are using ICMPv6 as a covert channel to circumvent security. You are tasked with intercepting this data stream without the target suspecting the data stream has been compromised. You are instructed to perform a Stateless Address Auto-Configuration (SLAAC) man-in-the-middle attack using ICMPv6 from a system on the same network as the target. Utilizing T2, create a SCAPY script to perform a MitM and intercept the data transmission.

    START FLAG = {provided in notification}

    Task: Scapy Man in the Middle (MitM) with ICMPv6

    Utilize the targets T1, T2, and T3 to create a SLAAC Router Advertisement message using Scapy to create a MitM.

    From T2, send a SLAAC ICMPv6 Router Advertisement message to T3.

    From T2, utilize TCPDUMP or Wireshark to intercept the FLAG being sent.

Task 3

Basic Analysis - Utilizing Berkeley Packet Filters

Type of Operation: PCAP Examination

Objective: You have been given a pcap of unknown contents for examination. You are tasked with performing basic analysis of the contents of this pcap using Berkeley Packet Filters (BPF).

    START FLAG = {provided in notification}
