SOCKET TYPES    
    STREAM SOCKETS 
        TCP oriented, methods for connection establishment and tear-down. Used with TCP, SCTP, and Bluetooth

    DATAGRAM SOCKETS
        UDP oriented,designed for quickly sending and receiving data

    RAW SOCKETS 
        Direct sending and receiving of IP packets without automatic protocol-specific formatting.
        
User Space vs. Kernel Space Sockets
    User Space Sockets
        The most common sockets that do not require elevated privileges to perform actions on behalf of user applications.
            Stream Sockets
            Datagram Sockets
    Kernel Space Sockets
        Attempts to access hardware directly on behalf of a user application to either prevent encapsulation/decapsulation or to create packets from scratch, which requires elevated privileges.
            Raw Sockets

        Modules

            Types
   
   Network sockets primarily use the Python3 Socket library and socket.socket function.
        import socket
          s = socket.socket(socket.FAMILY, socket.TYPE, socket.PROTOCOL)
   USING SOCKET
        socket.socket([*family*[,*type*[*proto*]]])
                family constants should be: AF_INET (default), AF_INET6, AF_UNIX
                type constants should be: SOCK_STREAM (default), SOCK_DGRAM, SOCK_RAW
                proto constants should be: 0 (default), IPPROTO_RAW
