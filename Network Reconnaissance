    PASSIVE - low impact, quieter
        Gathering info about targets without direct interaction
        requires more time
        
        We use this to identify:
            IP addresses and Sub-Domains
            External and 3rd party sites
            People and Technologies
            Content of Interest
            Vulnerabilities
           
           
        Tools For Recon:
            WHOIS queries
            Job site listings
            Phone Numbers
            Google searches
            Passive OS fingerprinting

           
        Passive External
            Information gathered outside of the network using passive methods
            Allows for more efficient attacks and plans

    NETWORK SCANNING
        Scanning Strategy
            Remote to Local
            Local to Remote
            Local to Local
            Remote to Remote (used for obfuscation/pivoting)
               
        Scanning Approach
        Aim
            Wide range target scan
            Target specific scan
        Method
            Single source scan
            Distributed scan
            
        Types of scans
            Broadcast Ping and Ping sweep for i in {1..354} ;do (ping -c 192.168.0.$i | grep "bytes from" &) ;done *************
            ARP scan
            SYN scan (just handshakes)
            Full connect scan (full handshake)
            Null scan
            FIN scan
            XMAS tree scan (all flags checked)
            UDP scan
            ACK/Window scan
            RPC scan
            FTP scan
            decoy scan (packets sent with different ips)
            OS fingerprinting scan
            version scan
            Protocol ping
            Discovery probes
            
        NMAP
            -sS = syn stealth scan
            
            TCP scan has root access
            default is full connect
            
        nmap [Options] [Target IP/ Subnet]
            nmap <ip w/cidr>
                -v -Pn -P 20-25,80
                
        nc [Options] [Target IP] [Target Port]
            -z = portscan mode
            -v = verbose
            nc -zv localhost 22 (shows us if ssh is open or closed)
            curl cht.sh/nc
            
        ps -elf
        netstat
            -antp
            -nltp
         nmap <ip w/cidr>
        
        ss -ntlp
            finds op ports on your device
        ip addr
        ip neighbor = see neighboring devices
        
        ssh vyos@172.16.20.5
            show config
                shows router configuration file
                descriptions tell what a device is used for
                press space to navigate
            show int
                shows a less verbose list of interfaces on a device
                
            IF I IDENTIFY A BOX:
                we are given a floating ip
                    nmap <ip addr> -Pn (no ping) -p (port) <specified ports i.e 20-25, 80>
                        Whats active?
                        FTP was active
                    ftp <ip addr>
                        shouldnt have a username/password most of the time
                    wget 10.50.21.41
                        gets the first file on an ip, defaulted to http not ftp
                            wget -r ftp://10.50.21.41
                                gets everything recursively off of that ftp server 
                                    annotate that you need creds for access
                    
                    ssh <user>@<ip addr>
                        if connection refused
                            nc 10.50.21.41 22
                                DO NOT TRUST THE PORTS
                                    find the real ssh
                                        ssh <user>@10.51.21.41 -p<port>
                                            whoami
                                                find flag
                                                    if you can ssh you can scp
                                                        save all hints/flags
                                                            if you cant find something in a scan, try it from another device
